        <h1>Guberstorm</h1>
        
        <p>This website is meant to store my thoughts on the Revolutions Custom Standard deck named Guberstorm, originally developed by Lih but developed into a faster though somewhat less resilient deck by me, despite one major relevant nerf of a card and an additional ban of a key sideboard card.</p>

        <h2>What's The Deck About?</h2>
        <p>The deck is built on and named after the card often abbreviated as
        <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/gub.jpg" data-caption="Gubernatorial Fundraiser">Guber</span>.</p>

        <p>Most of the card is self-explanatory, but for those who aren't coming here from Revolutions Custom Standard, the make a pledge mechanic effectively gets you an effect each time except the first. You have a choice of which effect you want, but in this deck, we always want <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/CNY10.jpg" data-caption="Treasures are how we win.">Vishanki</span><p>, which makes treasures.

        <p>If we are able to have 3 copies of this ability on the battlefield at once, then all 3-mana spells can be cast mana-neutral, because each will generate 3 treasures which can be spent on the next cast. This is the core "point" of the deck.</p>

        <h2>How do we get there?</h2>
        <p>One obvious way to get 3 copies of guber in play is to draw and play 3 copies of the card.
            Thankfully, we don't have to do that. What makes this deck a 3-card combo, which is feasible, rather than a 4-card combo, which is generally not, is the card <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/echo.jpg" data-caption="5 mana for two clones is an amazing rate">Reflected Echo</span>.
         If we start our turn with a Guber in play, you can cast Reflected Echo on it, and make 2 treasures, and then spend them and 2 more mana to flashback the card, we end up with 3 Gubers in play and 3 treasures which you can use to start the unlimited chain of 3-mana spells.</p>

        <h2>How do we win from there?</h2>
        <p>There's a lot of useful things you can do if 3-mana spells are free. We can play a bunch of 3-mana draw spells with useful side effects and do our best job at drawing our deck, all mana-positive.
            We will still want to play a lot of cards that effectively do this storm-like gameplan.
            There is, however, an even better thing we can use our mana on. After a lot of searches on the format's version of scryfall, lackeybot, I found the card <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/seer.jpg">Seer of the Aspirants</span>
            With this card in play, we can recast it repeatedly from play, getting an unlimited number of surveils. Using these surveils, we can dump our deck into the discard, including more <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/echo.jpg">Echoes</span>.
            Once we have a fourth guber in play, recasting seer gets us an unlimited number of treasures, which we can use in tandem with a <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/inferno.jpg">Dhante's Inferno</span> which we surveiled into the graveyard to drain our opponent for all their life.</p>.

        <h2>Topics</h2>
        <p>The topic pages in the navigation menu will list topics, either categories of card from which we must select some, or packages of cards which I have considered playing, or have been played, in the deck.
            A whole paragraph above is about how to win given 3 gubers in play. What turns out to be much more difficult, though, is getting there, in the face of creature removal, counterspells, hand attacks, and graveyard hate.</p>
