        <h1>Guberstorm</h1>
        
        <p>This website is meant to store my thoughts on the Revolutions Custom Standard deck named Guberstorm, originally developed by Lih but developed into a faster though somewhat less resilient deck by me, despite one major relevant nerf of a card and an additional ban of a key sideboard card.</p>

        <h2>How The Deck Wins</h2>
        <p>The deck is built on and named after the card often abbreviated as
        <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/gub.jpg" data-caption="Gubernatorial Fundraiser">Guber</span>.</p>

        <p>Most of the card is self-explanatory, but for those who aren't coming here from Revolutions Custom Standard, the make a pledge mechanic effectively gets you an effect each time except the first. You have a choice of which effect you want, but in this deck, we always want <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/CNY10.jpg" data-caption="Treasures are how we win.">Vishanki</span><p>

        <p>If one is able to have 3 copies of this effect on the battlefield at once, then all 3-mana spells can be cast mana-neutral, because each will generate 3 treasures which can be spent on the next cast.
            The original way to take advantage of this was to play many card draw spells, some of which are strongly mana-positive, and end up with a finite but very large number of treasures.
            I spotted the card
        <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/seer.jpg" data-caption="Sample Image 2">Seer of the Aspirants</span> which is able, with three Gubers in play, to cast itself from play repeatedly, and each time getting a surveil.
            We'll get into the details later, but suffice it to say that this is sufficient to win the game in almost every circumstance.
            In particular, if we can get a 4th <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/gub.jpg" data-caption="Pledging in this deck makes a treasure, except the first time you do it.">Guber</span> in play, we can generate infinite treasures
            by casting <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/seer.jpg" data-caption="Sample Image 2">Seer</span> repeatedly, and with infinite surveils, it is generally easy to get to this point.
        </p>

        <h2>Making the Combo</h2>
        <p>What makes this deck a 3-card combo, which is feasible, rather than a 4-card combo, which is generally not, is the card <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/echo.jpg" data-caption="5 mana for two clones is an amazing rate">Reflected Echo</span>.
         If you start your turn with a Guber in play, you can cast Reflected Echo on it, and make 2 treasures, and then spend them and 2 more mana to flashback the card, you end up with 3 Gubers in play and 3 treasures which you can use to start the unlimited chain of 3-mana spells.</p>

        <h2>Topics</h2>
        <p>The topic pages in the navigation menu will list topics, either categories of card from which we must select some, or packages of cards which I have considered playing, or have been played, in the deck.</p>
