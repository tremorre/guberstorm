        <h1>Topic 1: Example Content Page</h1>
        
        <p>This is an example content page. You can write anything you want here, and embed image triggers naturally within your text.</p>

        <h2>Section 1</h2>
        <p>When discussing 
        <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/sample1.jpg" data-caption="First Image">the first concept</span>, 
        you can reference images that appear on hover. This makes for a very interactive reading experience.</p>

        <p>You can have multiple image triggers in a single paragraph. For example, here's 
        <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/sample2.jpg" data-caption="Second Image">another reference</span> 
        and yet 
        <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/sample3.jpg" data-caption="Third Image">another one</span>.</p>

        <h2>Section 2</h2>
        <p>Each page can have its own unique content and reference different images. The beauty of this system is that 
        <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/sample4.jpg" data-caption="Fourth Image">it's very simple to add new triggers</span>.</p>

        <p>You can also link to other pages: see <a href="page2.html">Topic 2</a> for more information.</p>

        <h2>Section 3</h2>
        <p>Add as much text content as you need. The 
        <span class="image-trigger" data-image="images/sample5.jpg" data-caption="Fifth Image">final image</span> 
        on this page demonstrates that you can have many different image references throughout your content.</p>
